			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>
				 The past nine years of my life have been heavily involved within computing which started with the preoccupation and hobby of mine as well as a field of study starting at the age of 14 where I had the option to choose 
				it as a specific subject. Due to my outside of education interest within the subject of computing I believe I have an increased interest in learning anything computing based whether it be completely foreign to me or not. 
				I am currently studying a Bachelor’s Degree in Computing at DeMontfort University.  Along with my education I also work as a part time Chef in Nottingham for The Plough at Normanton on the Worlds which is currently 
				awaiting the results for the Nottingham Restaurant awards for multiple categories.

			<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>	
					Outside of employment and education, enjoyment and relaxation comes to me through the sense of music and staying healthy through exercise. This mainly comes through the visiting of the gym regularly in order to take part
					in weight training as well as cardio building. Through the use of the gym I believe I have become a better person through self-discipline. Another skill I believe I have learnt through the attending the gym is giving me a realistic outcome 
					on learning that some things simply take time to perfect rather than being lots amount of effort for very short periods of time.
